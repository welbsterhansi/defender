"""Batch-split-on-failure orchestrator.

The Azure Resource Graph engine sometimes rejects a large query with
``UnexpectedQueryExecutionError`` — meaning "too complex", not "try
again". Retrying the same call does not help; we must **split the batch
in half** and try the halves independently.

Ports the semantics of ``_scan_batch_recursive`` in ``defender.sh``.
